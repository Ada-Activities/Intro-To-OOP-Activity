# Intro To OOP Activity
This repo is the activity for the Intro to Object Oriented Programming.

## Directions
In this activity you will implement a [`Student`](activity/student.py) class and a function, [`get_student_with_more_classes`](activity/comparison.py), based on the clues from in the code located in [`main.py`](main.py). Think about what `attributes` and `methods` are being used and being called in the code.
